	<h2>Set password for xGDBvm website</h2>
<hr class="featuredivider" />
	<p><span  class="heading"><b >Navigation:</b> Left menu &rarr; Admin &rarr; Set Up Passwords </span></p>
	<p><b>Purpose:</b> This option allows you to password-protect the xGDBvm website over HTML</p>

    <p><b>Why do this?</b> If your data is private, you may want to limit access to any ability to view or download it. You can remove this setting later if and when you want to open up access.</p>
	
	<ul class="bullet1">
		  <li>With this option a username <b>('user')</b> and password are required on first accessing your VM over HTTP (uses .htaccess).</li>
		  <li> Enter a new password twice, then click <b>Update</b> button at right.You will then be asked to log in to the restricted page using these credentials.
				<ul class="bullet1">
				  <li> Your web browser should cache the password so you will not need to re-enter when you navigate away from/back to these pages </li>
				  <li> If you are working on a shared computer, make sure you quit out of your web browser at the end of the session.</li>
				</ul>
		  </li>
		  <li> You may change the password again if necessary</li>
		  <li> You can remove password protection by clicking <b>Remove</b> button at right</li>
	</ul>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> This option is <b>NOT RECOMMENDED</b> if you are also password-protecting administrative sections. The two password dialogs can get annoying. If you need two levels of protection, we recommend you use vpn to limit access to the web pages.</p>
