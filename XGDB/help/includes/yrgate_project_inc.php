	<p>If this locus is part of a specific <b>Annotation Project</b>, select it from the dropdown.</p>
	
	<p>Otherwise, select "none".</p>
	<!--p>Alternatively, create a new project name using "[other...]."</p-->

    <p class="bold warning">Note- if you would like a group of genes or loci assigned to an Annotation Project, send us a Project Name and a list of ID's and we will add them to the database.</p>
	
	<p class="bold">Q: How is a Project different from a Working Group? </p>
		<p>A:</p>
			<ul class="bullet1">
			<li>Projects are an informal working category, specific to each genome. </li>
			<li>Working Groups are designed for teams or classrooms and are by invitation only. They may encompass one genome or all genomes.</li>
			<li>Anyone can select any Project category in the dropdown list, whereas Working Groups are only visible to Group members</li>
		</ul>
