<h2>yrGATE Evidence Table</h2>
			<p>The yrGATE Evidence Table groups all exons based on overlapping position on the genome, and further subdivides them by coordinate pairs. For each coordinate pair, all evidence ID's and scores are displayed. Exons currently selected in the "Your Structure" model are indicated with a selected radio button.</p>
			<ul class="bullet1">
			<li>Exon groups are numbered consecutively, starting with the leftmost exon appearing in the selected genome region.</li>
			<li>Distinct exon coordinate pairs within a group are listed in column 1.</li>
			<li>Average alignment scores for each exon coordinate pair are indicated in column 2.</li>
			<li>All ID's supporting each exon coordinate pair are listed in column 3; click an ID to view individual aligment evidence.</li>
			</ul>
