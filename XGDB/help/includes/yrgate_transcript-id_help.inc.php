	<h2>Transcript ID</h2>

	<p>If your annotation addresses a <b>specific gene model</b> (to correct/improve, confirm, or recommend its deletion), select its <b>transcript ID</b> from the dropdown.</p>
	
	<p>This information will help curators to associate your annotation with an existing gene model.</p>
	
	<p>If your desired transcript ID does not appear, you may need to <b>expand the Genome Location</b> to encompass the model. Select a new start and/or end coordinate and click <i>Change Location</i>.</p>
