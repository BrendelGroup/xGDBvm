	<h2>Feature Tracks: Copy Number (transcript, protein)</h2>
<hr class="featuredivider" />

<p><b>Copy Number</b> indicates the number of locations in which the transcript or protein was successfully splice-aligned to the genome.</p>
	<ul class="bullet1">
		<li>1 indicates the sequence was splice-aligned to only 1 genome location </li>
		<li>&gt; 1 indicates the protein was splice-aligned to more than one genomic location. </li>
	</ul>
<p class="bold"> Copy Number Functions:</p>
	<ul class="bullet1">
<li>Use the 'Copy Number' filter to select all features with a selected copy number.</p>
<li>Click the "copy number" number in a table cell to view all genome regions to which that sequence was splice-aligned.</li>
</ul>
