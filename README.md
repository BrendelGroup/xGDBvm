# xGDBvm
A cloud-enabled genome annotation platform

xGDBvm is a web-based platform for annotating and visualizing eukaryotic genomes.
xGDBvm is available through the [iPlant/CyVerse Atmosphere platform](http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere), and leverages additional [NSF XSEDE cyberinfrastructure resources](https://www.xsede.org/) such as the [iPlant Data Store](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/data-store) and the [Agave API](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/data-store) to high-performance computing provided by the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/).

Users can deploy an xGDBvm virtual machine (VM) on-demand, upload and validate their data, and configure their genome database.
xGDBvm's processing pipeline can then compute spliced alignments of transcripts and proteins to the genome and annotate genes.
Alternatively, users can supply pre-computed alignments and/or gene models.
When the initial processing is complete, xGDBvm provides a fully-featured analysis platform including a genome browser, a web-based community annotation portal, a BLAST server, keyword search features, and more.
