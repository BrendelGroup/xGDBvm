                TROUBLESHOOTING tips at end of this document and on wiki

Latest update: 3-Feb-2016 J Duvick. For xGDBvm-v1.14 or greater.

 1) CONFIGURE YOUR VM USING SHELL COMMANDS:

 1A) Log in to your VM using a terminal emulator (ssh username@123.456.78.90) or use Atmosphere's 'Access by Shell'
 
 1B) Carry out steps listed below IN ORDER by typing commands at the $ prompt. Required responses are in [brackets]

     1.    Update xGDBvm code from git repository:    $ update-vm [y] [password] (updated files are listed)  
     2.    Run a setup script for your (new) VM       $ setup-vm [password][NOTE: You will also be
                                                       required to set a sitewide Web password for 'user']+++
     3.    Initialize IRODS/FUSE:                     $ iinit [y]  [username] [password]  (1-time only)
     4.    Mount your iPlant DataStore (for INPUT)+:  $ mount-datastore  [y] (mounts at /xGDBvm/input/)
     5.    Mount an external volume (for OUTPUT)++:   $ mount-volume [y] [password] [device location, e.g. /dev/vdc]               
     6.    Complete VM configuration:                 $ configure-vm [y] [password]
     7.    Check VM status:                           $ vm-status (shows volume attachment, storage capacity)
     
  +  Data Store mount is optional, but REQUIRED if you will be using High Performance Compute processing.
  
  ++ Volume mount is optional, but RECOMMENDED for data portability. The volume must already be attached to the VM to mount it.
  
  ++ NOTE: The mounted volume will be populated with all OUTPUT data, configurations, and archives.
           You can unmount it and remount to another VM to reproduce the entire GDB display (after re-running 'configure-vm').
           DO NOT attach a volume if you have already created one or more GDB on this VM using local storage.

  +++ Forgot your VM's Web password (sitewide or admin pages only)? 
     1. Remove the password flag: $ sudo rm /xGDBvm/admin/xgdbpassword or $ sudo rm /xGDBvm/admin/adminpassword 
     2. Re-run the 'setup-vm' script (step 2 above) and enter a new password

 1C) To unmount volume and Data Store, e.g. before you terminate a VM (make sure no processes are running) 

     1.    Unmount external volume        $ unmount-volume [y] [password]
     2.    Unmount Data Store             $ unmount-datastore [y] [password]
          - to remount and reconfigure to the same VM follow steps 4, 5, and 6 above    
 
2) ACCESS YOUR VM ONLINE (OR USING VNC). For Web access, type the IP address of your instance into
    your web browser, e.g. 123.456.78.90. For VNC access, follow instructions on the xGDBvm wiki: 
    http://goblinx.soic.indiana.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=vnc
   
    NOTE: xGDBvm will always connect over https (secure connection), so you will need to click 
    through several Web browser alerts to persuade your Web browser to accept the
    unverified iPlant certificate (procedure varies by Web browser). This is normal behavior.

*** Your xGDBvm instance is now configured and online. Be sure to password-protect it appropriately (Step 3)  ***
    
  A quick summary of steps you will take to prepare and annotate a genome using xGDBvm:
     1.    Complete the VM configuration process online (steps 3 - 5 below)       
     2.    Test your VM with sample data provided (step 6)  
     3.    Prepare input data on your Data Store under xgdbvm/, 
           e.g. /iplant/[username]/xgdbvm/myInputs/ = /xGDBvm/input/xgdbvm/myInputs/ (step 7)
     4.    Create a GDB configuration, e.g. GDB001 (enter GDB name, path to input data, parameter choices) and save it (step 8)
     5.    Initiate the GDB pipeline and monitor for errors; if necessary, terminate process and start over (step 9)
     6.    When complete, verify results by reviewing output reports and process logs; address any errors (step 10)                 
     7.    Archive your output and copy the archive back to your Data Store if desired (step 11)
     8.    Re-annotate manually or regionally using built-in tools; add or replace track data using Update feature (step 12)
    
*** The following steps are carried out via Web connection (or VNC) to your Instance:***

 3) (OPTIONAL) CHANGE INTERNET PASSWORD PROTECTION ON YOUR VM:
    -  Visit 'Manage -> Admin -> Set Up Passwords'
      -  Option 2 (protect entire Website, username='user') is the default and should be in effect for all NEW VMs
      -  Option 1 (protect Admin pages; username='admin') can be implemented if data are public (but first remove sitewide password)
    -  Share the password only with persons who have valid reason to access protected pages

 4) INSTALL LICENSE KEYS:
    - Some license keys are added to your Data Store 'keys' directory at configuration (/iplant/[username]/xgdbvm/keys)
    - Install these keys on your VM by visiting Manage -> Config -> License Keys and clicking to install each key
    - Follow directions to obtain any license keys not already on your Data store, deposit in 'keys' directory, and install. 
    - Note that when you store license copies on your Data Store you can easily install them on a new VM

 5) CONFIGURE REMOTE HPC (optional) 
    - Visit Manage -> Jobs -> Getting Started and check status flags for configuration and job running
    - If VM is new, you MUST register it via the Agave API (click 'Authorize/Login), using your credentials.
    - Once registered (a one-time event), you should be able to log in with the same credentials and submit jobs.
    - Update App IDs if needed (click 'Configure Apps') - check at http://goblinx.soic.indiana.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=hpc#current_app_ids 
    - Update API settings if needed (click 'Configure API') - check at http://goblinx.soic.indiana.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=agave&#current_api_settings
    
 6) TEST YOUR VM WITH "TOY" DATA 
   - LOAD EXAMPLE: Visit 'Manage -> Config -> Create New GDB'  and click 'Examples' to view test datasets
   - SELECT a dataset and click 'Save Example __'. Your GDB is now 'Development' status
   - PROCESS: On GDB config page, click 'Data Options... -> Create GDB' to run pipeline
   - CHECK OUTPUT: When completed, GDB will be 'Current' status and you can check output track counts
   - VERIFY: Visit 'View -> GDB' (home page) and click 'View Sample Region' to verify track visibility
   - TROUBLESHOOT if necessary by viewing pipeline log and error log 
        - GDB Home Page: 'GDBnnn -> Resources -> Pipeline Logs'
        - GDB Config Page: 'Logfile'
   - ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING RESOURCES:
        - $ sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/error_log  (pipeline script errors logged to the system)
        - $ sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log (web script errors logged to the system)
        - You can modify /etc/my.cnf to log MySQL errors (follow instructions there) -- be sure to turn off when done!
        
 7) PREPARE INPUTS: Once familiar with the process and prerequisites, prepare your GDB data as follows:
    - REVIEW INPUT SOURCES (Manage -> Config -> Data Sources) to determine what are appropriate input data files,
      according to what you want to accomplish and what data are available
    - REVIEW INPUT REQUIREMENTS and naming conventions for xGDBvm (Manage -> Config -> Data Requirements)
    - RENAME INPUT FILES accordingly and double check their FASTA headers and IDs
    - MOVE INPUT FILES TO DATA STORE (first create a new directory on Data Store under /iplant/[username]/xgdbvm/)
    - CHECK VOLUME CAPACITY (Manage -> Config -> Data Volumes) to confirm adequate capacity.
    - DETERMINE REMOTE COMPUTE RESOURCES (optional) (Manage -> Jobs -> Estimate Resources)
    - ADJUST REMOTE COMPUTE PARAMS (optional) (Manage -> Jobs -> Configure) depending on data size

 8) CONFIGURE GDB PIPELINE: 
    - CONFIGURE A NEW GDB (Manage -> Config -> Create New GDB)
       - Enter GDB Name, Species, Input Directory
       - Select any non-default Spliced Alignment parameters (Transcript/Protein)
       - Select 'Remote Compute' option if desired for High Performance Computing (HPC) of spliced alignments
       - Select Predict Genes = 'Yes' if you want to compute gene models using CpGAT
       - Enter optional configuration data as desired and click 'Save' at top of form.
    - VALIDATE INPUTS, EXPECTED OUTPUTS for your 'Development' GDB Configuration 
       - Review lists of valid-named inputs and expected outputs, error flags (at top of config form)
       - Validate file contents by clicking 'i' icon (detects duplicate or invalid IDs, enumerates counts)
       - Verify storage capacity to handle outputs (required: 5x-10x input data size)
    - PRE-RUN HPC job(s) as 'standalone' procedures if desired (Remote jobs -> Manage Jobs)
       - GDB input data (genome, transcript, protein) is automatically recognized when you select a GDB
       - Monitor HPC output in Remote Jobs -> List All Jobs, and click to tranfer output to GDB input directory
       - HPC outputs can then be used as inputs for the 'regular' GDB pipeline
       
 9) RUN GDB PIPELINE
    - INITIATE PIPELINE by clicking Data Process Options -> Create GDB
    - MONITOR PROGRESS by viewing the Logfile (accessible from the GDB Config page)
       - Note that while pipeline is running you will NOT be able to create any additional GDB.
       - If necessary, you can ABORT the pipeline by clicking 'Config page -> Data Process Options -> Abort'
    - HPC JOBS are monitored in Remote Jobs -> List Jobs
    - JOB FINISHED - GDB Config status will be 'Current' and you can access genome browser, tools, data.
    
10) CHECK OUTPUT
    - VERIFY TRACK DATA- check if tracks and feature counts are as expected ('GDB Config -> General Info -> Features)
    - VERIFY TRACK DISPLAY: Visit 'View -> GDB' (home page) and click 'View Sample Region' to verify track visibility
    - TROUBLESHOOT if necessary by viewing pipeline log and error log 
        - GDB Home Page: 'GDBnnn -> Resources -> Pipeline Logs'
        - GDB Config Page: 'Logfile'
 
11) MANAGE OUTPUT DATA
    - ARCHIVE GDB if OK: On GDB Config page click 'Data Process Options... -> Archive GDB' to
      save all data to a GDB archive (/xGDBvm/data/ArchiveGDB/GDBnnn/) on your External Volume
        - This allows you to restore the GDB if the VM is disconnected or data are corrupted.
    - DROP GDB to start pipeline over: Click 'Data Process Options... -> Drop GDB' to
      remove data tables, output directory and revert to 'Development' status
        - Now change input parameters or data inputs as appropriate and repeat steps 12, 13.
    - DELETE GDB to remove all output data AND configuration: visit 'Manage -> Config -> Archive/Delete'
      and click 'Delete Latest GDB'. THIS WILL ALSO DELETE ANY GDB ARCHIVE!!!
      
 12) EDIT/UPDATE GDB DATA
    - REANNOTATE gene models manually online using the yrGATE tool 
    - ADD ANNOTATIONS to a region or globally using CpGAT tool
    - ADD/MODIFY input data by selecting Update='Yes' in configuration page, and specifying update actions/data path.

########################  TROUBLESHOOTING your xGDBvm configuration    ###########################

1) Problem:	I get a "no database" error when accessing site over HTTP.

   Solution: try restarting MySQL (as sudo):

    $ sudo /sbin/service mysqld restart
  
  Or, run the configuration script again:
  
    $ configure-vm
    $ sudo /xGDBvm/scripts/iPlantMySQLinit.sh (manual)
	
2) Problem:	After I create a genome browser (e.g. GDB001), I cannot view it
     over HTTPS (I get an error message)

   Solution: Make sure there is a 'tmp' file under /xGDBvm/data/, and
     that it has correct permissions. All image and
     other temporary files generated by the genome browser are cached there and
     must be accessible to the Web server.

3) Problem: I am unable to successfully mount an External Volume at e.g. /dev/vdc

   Solution: Make sure /dev/vdc (or other device location) exists on your VM; it is created when you attach
   the Volume from Atmosphere control panel, but it may take several minutes to appear. 
   It is also possible the Volume is damaged and you may have to delete it and create a new one.
