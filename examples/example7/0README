Example 7 (Pre-Computed Data)

This is an example dataset consisting of four Ricinus communis scaffolds, along with the est, cdna, put and related species (Arabidopsis and Medicago) proteins that splice-align to them.
For this example, we assume spliced alignments (GeneSeqer and GenomeThreader) have already been run separately, and the output files are included in the same directory.
Also, this example is configured to allow the user to Update using the "CpGAT replace" option.
