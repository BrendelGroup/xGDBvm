Example 9

This is an example dataset for testing the HPC compute options for GenomeThreader (protein) spliced alignment.
Input data consist of four Ricinus communis scaffolds, along with the est and related species (Arabidopsis and Medicago) proteins that splice-align to them.
Also included are precomputed gene models in a gff3 formatted table.
