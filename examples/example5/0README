Example 5 (CpGAT + Update Options)

This is an example dataset consisting of two Ricinus communis scaffolds, along with the est, cdna, put and related species (Arabidopsis and Medicago) proteins that splice-align to them.
For this example, we assume additional data is to be added, and these data are contained in a subdirectory called new_data.
We also assume that CpGAT will be run, and that on update CpGAT will also be run.
	
Input Data Directory contents: /xGDBvm/examples/Example2

	GenomesExample5.txt - this is the configuration data that will be loaded when user selects this example.
	
	Data files:
	
	old_scaffold.fasta - genomic sequence for 2 Ricinus communis  scaffolds (fasta formatted)
	old_Rc_4scaff_GDBest.fasta - cDNA sequences for spliced alignment to genome using GeneSeqer
	old_Rc_4scaff_GDBcdna.fasta - EST sequences for spliced alignment to genome using GeneSeqer
	old_Rc_4scaff_GDBput.fasta - transcript assembly (PUT) sequences for spliced alignment to genome using GeneSeqer
	old_Rc_4scaff_GDBprotein.fasta - transcript assembly (PUT) sequences for spliced alignment to genome using GeneSeqer
	my_old.gff - gff3-formatted gene models published by JGI for version 1.0 of the Ricinus communis genome.
	old_Rc4scaff_GDBpep.fasta - protein translations derived from published gene models (same as above)
	Description.txt - tab-delimited file matching gene IDs with functional descriptions, from the R. communis JGI genome annotation. These descriptions are loaded to the GDB database for display along with the gene models.
