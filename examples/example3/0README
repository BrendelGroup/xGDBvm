Example 3 (Pre-Computed Data)

This is an example dataset consisting of four Ricinus communis scaffolds, along with the est, cdna, put and related species (Arabidopsis and Medicago) proteins that splice-align to them.
For this example, we assume spliced alignments (GeneSeqer and GenomeThreader) have already been run separately, and the output files are included in the same directory.
