Example 6 (Repeat Mask/CpGAT option). This is an example dataset consisting of four Ricinus communis scaffolds, along with the est, cdna, put and related species (Arabidopsis and Medicago) proteins that splice-align to them. Included is a reference protein index for CpGAT and a small "fake" repeat mask index (consisting of several genic regions from Rc)
