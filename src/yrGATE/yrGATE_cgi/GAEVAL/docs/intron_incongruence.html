    <h2 style="clear:left;">Using Intron Incongruence</h2>
    <p>
      GAEVAL uses the analysis of introns both to determine the support for a
      given annotation and to explain inconsistencies between annotation
      structures and evidence alignments. Inconsistencies such as alternative 
      splicing are further descibed by GAEVAL using the following incongruent
      intron flags. GAEVAL extends each flag with a 'documented' property
      which helps to distinguish novel incongruencies from those already 
      documented in the current annotation collection.
    </p>
    <h3>Alternatively Annotated Introns</h3>
    <p>The 'Alternatively Annotated Intron' flag is given to an intron defined 
      by the given annotation which is
      not found in other available annotation isoforms. Annotation isoforms are
      considered to be all other annotations in the current annotation set which
      share at least one common intron with the current annotation or overlap
      the current annotation by at least one-thousand bases. The 'documented'
      property of this flag is set when the intron is supported by an isoform 
      specific evidence (ISE) alignment.
    </p>
    <h3>Alternative Introns</h3>
    <p>The 'Alternative Intron' flag is given to an intron defined by an ISE 
      alignment which is not present in the current annotation and is within
      the boundaries of the current annotation. The 'documented' property of
      this flag is set when this intron is present in the structure of one
      or more annotation isoforms as defined above.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Introns</h3>
    <p>The 'Additional Intron' flag is given to an intron defined by an ISE 
      alignment which is not present in the current annotation yet is also outside
      the boundaries of the current annotation. The 'documented' property of
      this flag is set when this intron is present in the structure of one
      or more annotation isoforms as defined above.
    </p>
    <h3>Conflicting Introns</h3>
    <p>The 'Conflicting Intron' flag is given to an intron defined by the
      given annotation which is inconsistent with a cognate ISE alignment.
      The 'documented' property of
      this flag is set when this intron is present in the structure of one
      or more annotation isoforms as defined above.
    </p>
    <h3>Pseudo Introns</h3>
    <p>The 'Pseudo-Intron' flag is given to an intron defined by the given
      annotation which is inconsistent with a cognate ISE alignment and is
      supported by a noncognate evidence alignment. The 'documented' property
      is not used for this flag.
