      Included in this package are example annotations and evidence alignments 
      provided in <a href="http://song.sourceforge.net/gff3.shtml">GFF3 format</a>. Each 
      example is included to highlight features of the GAEVAL algorithm and
      considerations for 'real-world' application. Detailed descriptions
      of each example as well as highlights of the GAEVAL output for each
      are available using the links on the left side of these pages.<BR>

      Individual examples can be run using the following command line format.

    <h3>Example 1: Single Annotation with Evidence (the simple life)</h3>
    <p>
      This example introduces the basic report capabilities of GAEVAL including a
      summary of each analyzed annotation showing genomic source, structure, ORF,
      5'UTR, CDS, 3'UTR. Each GAEVAL report also includes a 'Structure Analysis'
      section detailing the support for the given annotation structure based on
      supplied evidence alignments. Also available in each GAEVAL report is an
      'Incongruency Analysis' section describing possible sources of incongruence
      between the annotation and given evidence alignments.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 2: Erroneously Overlaping Annotations</h3>
    <p>
      This example illustrates a very specific form of incongruence in which an 
      automated annotation process has erroneously extended an annotation
      structure through the ambiguous inclusion of an evidence alignment in
      multiple adjacent gene structures.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 3: Alternative Splicing</h3>
    <p>
      This example illustrates the use of GAEVAL in evaluating alternative splicing.
      In addition to the standard evaluation of observed incongruent introns, this
      example also showcases the ability of GAEVAL to determine if an incongruent 
      structure has previously been documented by an alternatively spliced isoform 
      (alternative transcript of the evaluated annotation) 
    </p>
    <h3>Example 4: Alternative Transcript Termination</h3>
    <p>
      This example illustrates the ability of GAEVAL to determine the presence of
      alternative cleavage/polyadenylation site usage based on the clustering of
      end defining evidence such as three-prime EST alignments.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 5: Annotation Fission / Split</h3>
    <p>
      This example illustrates the ability of GAEVAL to detect evidence suggesting
      that an annotation be split into two individual annotations.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 6: Annotation Fusion / Merger</h3>
    <p>
      This example illustrates the ability of GAEVAL to detect evidence suggesting
      the merger of adjacent annotations.
    </p>
    <h3>Example 7: Pseudo-Introns</h3>
    <p>
      This example illustrates the ability of GAEVAL to detect annotation structures
      resulting from the use of noncognate / homologous sequence alignments which are
      incongruent with cognate evidence alignments.
