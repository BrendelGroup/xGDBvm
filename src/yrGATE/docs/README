yrGATE Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

This document describes how to install the yrGATE package on a local machine.  
Local installation of yrGATE is appropriate for those interested in maintaining 
their own annotation commmunity and in customizing input data.  A local 
installation is not required to use the yrGATE Annotation Tool.  Open access to 
several yrGATE implementations is provided over the web at 
http://www.plantgdb.org/yrGATE/.  This document contains installation 
instructions, and a brief description of the yrGATE components.  Linux is the 
recommended operating system for yrGATE.  Other operating systems may be tested 
and accomodated in the future.

yrGATE INSTALLATION
-------------------
yrGATE is a collection of perl scripts, which provide web interfaces and 
database interaction, and javascript/html files.
yrGATE has the following directories:
	conf
	db
	docs
	yrGATE_cgi
	yrGATE_html

The yrGATE_cgi directory needs to be handled as CGI scripts by your apache 
webserver.  The yrGATE_html directory needs to be handled as static files by 
your apache webserver.  One way to achieve this is to edit your apache 
configuration file.  This method will be described below. (Alternatively, one 
could move the directories into the default CGI and html directories on your 
machine.)


0.  Confirm you have the requirements listed in the requirements section.

1. cd to the directory where you would like to install yrGATE.

	% cd /
or
	% cd /usr/local/src

2. unpack the archive:

	% tar -zxvf yrGATE.tar.gz

3. Change ownership of tmp directory to apache.  This directory will contain 
evidence plot images of the Annotation Tool.
	
	% mkdir yrGATE/yrGATE_html/tmp
	% chown apache yrGATE/yrGATE_html/tmp

4. Edit the apache configuration file.

	Append the following to your httpd.conf file (this is often located at 
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf):


 # yrGATE
  Alias /yrGATE "/yrGATE/yrGATE_html/"
  ScriptAlias /yrGATE-cgi "/yrGATE/yrGATE_cgi/"
  <LocationMatch "/yrGATE-cgi">
      SetEnv PERL5LIB .:/yrGATE/conf:/yrGATE/yrGATE_cgi
  </LocationMatch>


Note:
The aliases can be prefixed with an additional path for the URL or for the 
local yrGATE directory on your machine.  This readme presents an example for a 
directory installed at /yrGATE/ on your machine, that is accessed with URLs of 
the form http://localhost/yrGATE.  You can change either of these paths to your 
liking.

For example, if yrGATE was located at /usr/local/src/ the apache configuration 
file would be:
 # yrGATE
  Alias /yrGATE "/usr/local/src/yrGATE/yrGATE_html/"
  ScriptAlias /yrGATE-cgi "/usr/local/src/yrGATE/yrGATE_cgi/"
  <LocationMatch "/yrGATE-cgi">
      SetEnv PERL5LIB .:/usr/local/src/yrGATE/conf:/usr/local/src/yrGATE/yrGATE_cgi
  </LocationMatch>



ANNOTATION DATABASE SETUP
--------------------------------
yrGATE stores annotation and user information in a Mysql database.
This procedure describes how to set up this database.  


1. Create yrgate database. (You will probably need to be root.)
	% mysql -u root -p
	mysql> create database yrgate;

2. Add a user with full priveledges to the database. This can be 'yrgateUser' 
or something different.

	mysql> grant all on yrgate.* to yrgateUser;
	mysql> grant all on yrgate.* to yrgateUser@localhost;
	mysql> exit;

3. Load the yrgate schema.
	% mysql -u root -p yrgate < yrGATE/db/yrGATE.community.db.sql



EVIDENCE DATABASE INSTALLATION
------------------------------
The input to yrGATE consists of genome sequence, exon evidence, and exon 
references. The yrGATE distribution includes a small database of exon evidence 
for testing purposes. This database is portion of PlantGDB's maize database, 
ZmGDB.  This procedure describes how to set up and load this database.

1. Create local_maize database. (You will probably need to be root.)
	% mysql -u root -p
	mysql> create database local_maize;

2. Add a user with select priveledges to the database.  This can be 
'yrgateUser' or something different.

	mysql> grant select on local_maize.* to yrgateUser@localhost;
	mysql> exit;

3. Load the local_maize schema and data.
	% mysql -u root -p local_maize < yrGATE/db/local_maize.sql


The included genome sequence for this evidence database is found at: 
yrGATE/db/zm.fsa.
The included exon references for this evidence database are GeneSeqer alignment 
files found at : yrGATE/yrGATE_html/local_maize_evidence
These does not need to be adjusted for this setup.


CONFIGURING yrGATE
------------------
The conf directory contains the configuration file for yrGATE.  The 
configuration file is a perl script that is mainly two hashes.  The hash GV 
contains the configuration variables. There are many options for configuring 
yrGATE.  Two example configuration files are provided.  One is configured for 
das input. (yrGATE_das_community.pl) Another is configured for using the 
database local_maize as input. (yrGATE_conf_local_maize.pl) The active 
configuration file is the file that is named yrGATE_conf.pl.


A. DAS INPUT DATA CONFIGURATION:

To use the das input configuration file:
	
	% cp yrGATE/conf/yrGATE_conf_das_input.pl yrGATE/conf/yrGATE_conf.pl

That is all that is needed for the 'das input' configuration.


B. LOCAL DATABASE INPUT DATA CONFIGURATION

Here, the necessary lines that need to be edited for your installation using 
the database local_maize as the input, are described.  A moderate understanding 
of perl is beneficial for this procedure.  

	Copy the template configuration file.
	% cp yrGATE/conf/yrGATE_conf_local_maize.pl yrGATE/conf/yrGATE_conf.pl
	
	Open the configuration file in a text editor, such as vi.
	% vi yrGATE/conf/yrGATE_conf.pl


1. PATHS.

rootPATH is the root URL of your machine.  This needs to begin with 'http://' 
and end with a forward slashes.  The following will be appropriate for most 
cases.
	rootPATH => "http://localhost/",

CGIPATH and HTMLPATH are the Alias paths specificed in the apache configuration 
file for yrGATE.  These paths need to begin and end with forward slashes.  If 
you used the root directory, this will be:
	CGIPATH => "/yrGATE-cgi/",
	HTMLPATH => "/yrGATE/",


tempImageWebDir is the path to the directory that images are written and whose 
ownership was changed in the yrGATE installation section.  If you used the
 /usr/local/src as the root directory, it will be:
       tempImageWebDir => "/usr/local/src/yrGATE/yrGATE_html/tmp/",


2. EVIDENCE DATABASE CONNECTIONS
 These are the connections to the Login, Annotation, and Evidence databases.  
These are in the form of Perl DBI connections.  If you used the example 
database name, and user please adjust these according.  Otherwise you do not 
need to adjust these.  (The attribute for the Annotation and User Database 
needs to be {PrintError=>1,RaiseErrror=>1} in order to work correctly.)

  	LDBH => 
DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:yrgate:localhost",'yrgateUser','',\%attr), # connection 
to users, and admin_session table
	ADBH => 
DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:yrgate:localhost",'yrgateUser','',\%attr), # connection 
to annotation database
        DBH => 
DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:local_maize:localhost",'yrgateUser','',\%attr), # 
connection to evidence database


3. CONFIGURE LOGIN

The following lines are already set for active login, in the template 
yrGATE_conf files.  session_path refers to the path where php sets session 
variables on your machine.  This may need to be changed on some systems.  
Session variables are created in perl using PHP::Session, to accomodate php to 
have reading/writing of this session variable.		

  	login_required => 1,
    	SessCookieName => "yrGATEsession",
      	SessLoginParam => "yrGATElogin",
     	session_path => "/tmp",


4. CONFIGURE EMAIL COMMUNICATION OF ANNOTATIONS (optional)

Email communication of new, accepted, and rejected annotations is deactivated 
in the template yrGATE_conf files.  To activate email, adjust the following 
lines.  email, when set to 1, will try to send emails.  AdminEmail is an 
administrator email list.  emailBin is the path to sendmail.  You will want to 
confirm that sendmail is working on your machine, before activating this.

       	email => 1,
       	AdminEmail => "annotation\@iastate.edu",
       	emailbin => "/usr/sbin/sendmail",



C. ADVANCED: ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION OF CUSTOM EVIDENCE DATABASES

This is appropriate for those wishing to use their own Mysql database for input 
data.  The following information is needed for exon evidence:

[dbName,evidence method,evidence unique id,evidence 
name,start,stop,score,number of exon, reference]

Number of exon is optional.  Reference is a url to the primary reference for 
the evidence such as an alignment and is optional.

Assuming you have a query that returns the above information, you can specify 
this in the following function, replacing 'your query' with your query.  This 
query should return evidence bounded by the genome segment, start, and end 
parameters. For example, ((a.l_pos <= 
$PRM->{end})&&(a.r_pos>=$PRM->{start})&&(a.chr='$PRM->{chr}')).  Refer to the 
example in the in yrGATE_conf_local_maize.pl for further information.
		
               	evidenceSources => sub {
                                       my $arr = [
                                                 ["cdna","red",your query],
                                                 ["est","blue",your query]
                                                 ];
					},


The genome sequence input also needs to be adjusted for custom input.  The 
provided genome sequence function is indicated in the configuration file.

	GenomeSeqFunction => "getGenomeSequence_ex"

This subroutine getGenomeSequence_ex is an example and should only be used for 
testing.  This should be edited to return the genome segment corresponding to 
the genome segment name, start and stop.  Fastacmd, of the blast package, can 
be easily configured to accomplish this on your machine.



testing yrGATE
--------------
You should be ready to test your installation.
The main url for your installation is:

http://localhost/yrGATE-cgi/CommunityCentral.pl

(You may need to adjust the path to reflect any changes you made in the 
configuration.)

Two default accounts are provided with the database for testing.
The usernames are 'testuser' and 'testadmin', and they have no password.
These accounts are only included for testing and should be removed after 
testing.

The following instructions describe how to quickly create, submit, and accept a 
gene annotation.

1. Click the login button, and login as 'testuser'.
2. To create an annotation, click on the 'sample genome entry' link, which will 
open a new window with the Annotation Tool.
3. Create a gene annotation.
   a. Select some exons from the Evidence Table or Evidence Plot
   b. Assign a protein coding region using the 'ORF Finder' button.
   c. Give your annotation a name in the 'Gene Name' field.
4. Click the 'Submit' button at the top of the Annotation Tool window.
5. Close the Annotation Tool Window.
6. Click the 'Annotation Account' button at the top of the Community Central 
page.
7. Notice your annotation is now listed under the status 'SUBMITTED_FOR_REVIEW'.
8. Logout by clicking the logout button at the top of the window.
9. Click on the login button and login as 'testadmin'
10. Click on the 'Administrate Annotations' button at the top of the window.
11. Click on the Annotation ID of the annotation that you submitted while 
logged as 'testuser'.  This will open the Annotation Tool.
12. Accept the annotation by clicking on the 'ACCEPT' button.
13. Click on 'the Community Central' button at the top of the 'Administrate 
Annotations' window.
14. Notice the annotation you just accepted is now listed under accepted.
15. Logout by clicking the logout button.
16. Notice the annotation is still presented on the 'Community Central' window.

After you are satisfied with your testing, remove the user accounts from the 
yrgate database:

	% mysql yrgate -u yrgateUset
	mysql> delete from users where userName = 'testuser' or username = 
'testadmin';

New administrator accounts can be created using the command (replacing the 
relevant fields).

mysql> insert into users (user_name,pword,account_type,fullname,email,phone) 
VALUES ('admin',password('some password'),'ADMIN','administrator 1' , 
'admin@somehost.com','1234567');

New user accounts can be created with the 'Annotator Registration' button 
accessible through the 'Community Central' page.




using yrGATE with a Genome Database
-----------------------------------

yrGATE can be used for multiple organisms, and databases. A different 
configuration file is required for each organism/database.

One way to distinguish configuration files is to create different aliases in 
your apache configuration.  These aliases will also reference different conf 
directories.  These different yrGATE_conf.pl files will need to be adjusted for 
the information described in the yrGATE installation section.

However, the same yrgate database can store annotations for multiple organisms 
and genome databases.  These are distinguished by the organism and dbName 
fields in the user_gene_annotation table.

A genome browser can be linked to yrGATE at the entry points of the Community 
Annotation Central or the Annotation Tool.  The Annotation Tool can be used 
seperately from the Community Utilities.  The file 'utility.diagram.pdf' 
contains a link diagram, which can aid in incorporating yrGATE with a genome 
browser.
